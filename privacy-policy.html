            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br></p>
            <p>Our Website is using Cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.<br></p>
            <p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.<br></p>
            <p>Through the use of cookies, <a href="http://Leanboard.io">Leanboard.io</a> can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.<br></p>
            <p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie<br></p>
            <p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.<br></p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>Purposes and legal basis for our processing of Data</strong><br></p>
            <p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 point (a) GDPR. You are then able to provide further personal data voluntarily or to permit third parties to transfer these to us and to store these with us for use in the context of using our services, in particular where you provide consent to the transfer of such personal data to third parties for the purpose of registering with third parties or the administration of your legal relationship to these third parties.<br></p>
            <p>The basis for data processing is further Art. 6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows us the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract. In the context of our agreement with you, we also process personal data in order to show you use that has already taken place in the recent past and to make corresponding suggestions for further use. The legal basis for the processing of such Data is Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 point (b) GDPR, since such processing is necessary for the performance of the agreement entered into between you and us. <br></p>
            <p>Finally, we also process personal data in your and our interest in order to ensure the integrity, trustworthiness and availability of the data processing systems, i.e. in particular the security and availability of your personal data with <a href="http://Leanboard.io">Leanboard.io</a>. The legal basis for the processing of such personal data is Art. 6 paragraph 1 no. 1 point (f) GDPR; our legitimate interest is the maintenance and the secure provision of our services.<br></p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>Routine Erasure or Restriction of Processing of Personal Data</strong><br></p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://Leanboard.io">Leanboard.io</a> shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage or as far as this is granted by the legislator or by other legislators in laws or regulations, to which <a href="http://Leanboard.io">Leanboard.io</a> is subject to.<br>
            </p>
            <p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.<br></p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>Data Protection Provisions for the use of Google Analytics (with anonymization Function)</strong><br></p>
            <p>On this website we have integrated the component of Google Analytics (with Anonymization function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web Analytics is the collection, gathering and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A Web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about from which website a person has come to another website (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web Analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.<br></p>
            <p>The operation company of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.<br></p>
            <p>For the web analytics through Google Analytics <a href="http://Leanboard.io">Leanboard.io</a> uses the application “_gat. _anonymizeIp”. By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymized when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.<br></p>
            <p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.<br></p>
            <p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are is explained above. With the setting of the cookie Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by <a href="http://Leanboard.io">Leanboard.io</a> and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google-Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. In course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently create commission settlements.<br></p>
            <p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.<br></p>
            <p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent that Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted anytime via a web browser or other software programs.<br></p>
            <p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility to object to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and to prevent such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person that is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.<br></p>
            <p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy</a> and under <a href="http://google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a>. Google Analytics is further explained under the following Link <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">google.com/analytics</a>.<br></p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the possibility to install the browser add-on above mentioned, you can klick the following link Deactivate Google Analytics for this website and set an opt-out-cookie to block the collection of personal data by Google Analytics. This cookie is working only within this browser and for this domain. If you delete your browser cookies, then you delete this opt-out-cookie too and you have to klick the link again.   <br></p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p><strong>Data Protection Provisions for the use of Facebook Pixel</strong><br></p>
            <p>Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider’s website. This allows an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.<br></p>
            <p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users’ identities.<br></p>
            <p>However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have no control over how this data is used. Further information and the applicable data protection provisions may be retrieved under: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">facebook.com/about/privacy</a>.<br></p>
            <p>You can also deactivate the custom audiences remarketing feature in the Ads Settings section at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen">facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen</a>. Therefore you will first need to log into Facebook. <br></p>
            <p>If you do not have a Facebook account, you can opt out of usage-based advertising from Facebook on the website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance: <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/">youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement</a>.<br></p>
